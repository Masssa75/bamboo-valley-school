    "heroTitle": "Building Schools for the Life We Actually Want",
    "heroSubtitle": "This is for parents who want nothing less than extraordinary lives for their children.",
    "byFounders": "By Nutthanit and Marc Schwyn",
    "intro1": "We're parents of three, and like you, we want the absolute best for our children. We see that pure wonder in their eyes, that natural joy, that bright spark that makes them who they are. It's the most beautiful thing in the world.",
    "intro2": "So when the time came to choose a school for our first child, we couldn't find a single one that felt right. She was three - an age of pure magic and discovery. But every kindergarten we found was designed for parent convenience, not child development. Even the 'good' schools offered the same formula: sterile indoor rooms, artificial lights, plastic materials, and already the pressure to 'prepare for academic success.'",
    "intro3": "Like so many of you, we couldn't bear the thought of watching the world slowly dim our children's magic and diminish their limitless potential.",
    "movingTitle": "Moving to Phuket",
    "moving1": "Five years ago, we decided the city wasn't working for us. We couldn't find the right school, children were trapped indoors, traffic and pollution made it hard to go anywhere, and we barely had time together as a family. So we moved to a beach in Phuket, hoping for more space, more nature, and more time with our children.",
    "moving2": "What we discovered there was nothing short of magical. We learned that children completely transform when given two simple things: genuine time with their parents (we're talking 3-5 hours a day) and daily access to nature. That's it. No expensive programs, no complex methods. Just these two ingredients.",
    "moving3": "The transformation is immediate and profound. Difficult children become helpful. Nagging stops. They ask to learn. They want to contribute. It sounds impossible, but any parent can test this - give your child focused time in nature for just a few days and watch the magic unfold.",
    "struggleTitle": "Why Parents Struggle",
    "struggle1": "Let's be honest about something that 95% of parents know but rarely say out loud: parenting in modern society is brutally, exhaustingly difficult.",
    "struggle2": "It wasn't always this way. Historically, families lived in communities. When you had children, your parents, grandparents, neighbors, and extended family all helped raise them together. It truly took a village.",
    "struggle3": "Today? You're not a village. You're isolated parents, often both working full-time jobs, with zero help at home. You wash dishes, do laundry, clean house, manage schedules, help with homework, handle bedtime routines - everything. When do you have 3-5 hours to just be present with your children? You barely have time to shower.",
    "struggle4": "So you put them in front of screens just to recover. Not because you're a bad parent - because you're drowning.",
    "dreamTitle": "Raising Dream Children",
    "dream1": "Like you, we've always loved our children desperately and wanted the absolute best for them. We tried everything - researching the perfect foods, finding the best learning methods, carefully choosing their environment and friends, modeling the right behaviors. We read every parenting book, implemented every strategy.",
    "dream2": "Then difficult times hit. Work demanded more. We were away more. And we watched our daughter transform - but not in a good way. She became difficult, naggy, bossy, rebellious. She absorbed negative influences from other children, from screens. She stopped listening to us. It broke our hearts.",
    "dream3": "But here's when the pattern became undeniable: Every time we took a full weekend to just BE with our daughters - no distractions, just presence - they transformed back into the most magical beings. By Sunday night, they were perfect. Not obedient-robot perfect, but joyful, helpful, curious, loving perfect. Dream children.",
    "dream4": "So we made a radical decision. When problems arose, we stopped reaching for punishments or explanations or any of the traditional parenting tools. We reached for time. Just time together.",
    "dream5": "What happens when you genuinely spend time with your children is almost mystical. Those annoying behaviors they picked up from others? You mention you don't like them - maybe not the first time, maybe not even the fifth - but eventually they simply stop. Not because you punished them. Because they love you and when you're present, they naturally want to please you.",
    "dream6": "But here's the deeper magic: Children learn by copying. When you're absent, they copy whoever is there - other children, screens, anyone. When you're present, they copy YOU. They mirror your mannerisms, your interests, your values. They spontaneously say \"I love you.\" They ask to learn what you know. They want to help with whatever you're doing.",
    "natureTitle": "Why Nature Matters",
    "nature1": "When we moved from our small Bangkok apartment to Phuket, just a minute's walk from the beach, we witnessed something that seemed impossible.",
    "nature2": "Picture this: In our Bangkok apartment, our two daughters would fight constantly. Even with 50 toys available, they'd battle over the exact same one every 15 minutes. There's something about indoor spaces, about bought stuff, that creates competition and conflict.",
    "nature3": "But take those exact same children at that exact same moment and walk outside into nature - to the woods, to our beach - and the fighting stops. Completely. They run around, play with sticks, dig in sand, splash in waves. Those sticks become toys, but somehow they don't fight over them. The competition vanishes.",
    "nature4": "Nature floods children with endless questions: Why do leaves spiral that way? What made these tracks? Why does this mushroom grow on dead wood? Every walk outside presents infinite mysteries - a single tree holds more learning opportunities than a room full of educational posters.",
    "nature5": "Our 3.5-rai palm plantation isn't just a pretty setting. It's a living laboratory where curiosity explodes naturally. Children discover Fibonacci patterns in real plants, witness life and death cycles, watch storms build and water find its path. They're not memorizing facts about physics - they're building dams and testing them. They're not studying ecosystems from books - they're living in one.",
    "paradiseTitle": "The Paradise School",
    "paradise1": "These discoveries changed everything about how we thought about education. If 3-5 hours of time transforms children... if nature eliminates conflict... if children desperately want to learn when we stop forcing them... then why are we sending them to schools designed around the exact opposite principles?",
    "paradise2": "So we're building a paradise where parenting becomes easy, not exhausting. Where children naturally want to learn instead of resisting at every turn. Where they develop academic excellence, deep confidence, genuine social skills, physical vitality, emotional intelligence - all through joy instead of struggle. Where your child wakes up excited for each day and comes home energized, not depleted.",

      "environment": "Creating an Environment Children Want to Copy",
      "environmentDesc": "Children don't learn by being taught. They learn by copying what surrounds them. Everything in our environment is designed to give the same message - the way teachers move and speak, what older children are doing, the materials available, the rhythm of the day.",
      "timing": "Perfect Timing Multiplies Everything",
      "timingDesc": "There's a window for every skill where children are naturally ready. Force reading at 3 when their bodies want to climb trees, and you create years of struggle. Wait until they're desperately curious at 6, and they learn in weeks what would have taken painful years.",
      "tool": "The Right Tool at the Perfect Moment",
      "toolDesc": "When a child hits a learning block, most schools just drill harder. We've learned that's like trying to break down a door when there's a key available.",
      "community": "The Community That Multiplies Magic",
      "communityDesc": "We've designed our location with spaces for regular family BBQs, farmers markets, workshops. When families align with what happens at school - not through rules but through genuine understanding - the transformation becomes unstoppable."
    },
    "paradise3": "This is what we're building. Not just another school, but a complete ecosystem designed around how children actually thrive. Where excellence isn't forced but emerges naturally. Where childhood isn't sacrificed for achievement but becomes the very source of it. Your children already have everything they need to be extraordinary. We're just creating the conditions where it happens naturally.",
    "foundationTitle": "Our Educational Foundation",
    "foundation1": "Our approach is rooted in Waldorf education, outdoor learning, the British curriculum, and the fundamental belief that children have a strong innate drive to learn and excel. We blend these elements differently at each developmental stage to nurture extraordinary human beings.",

    "intro2": "The core insight is simple but powerful: children who struggle with behavior aren't choosing to be difficult. They're lacking skills — skills like flexibility, frustration tolerance, or problem-solving. When we help them build these skills, the behavior improves naturally.",

    "whyConsequencesDontWork": "Why Consequences Alone Don't Work",
    "consequences1": "Think about it this way: if your child could behave well just by being motivated, they would already be behaving well. No child wants to be in trouble. No child wants to disappoint their parents and teachers.",
    "consequences2": "When a child struggles repeatedly despite consequences, it tells us something important: motivation isn't the problem. The child is lacking a skill — maybe emotional regulation, flexibility when plans change, or the ability to express frustration with words instead of actions.",
    "analogy": "A helpful analogy: If a child struggled with reading, we wouldn't punish them for reading poorly. We'd figure out what specific skill they're missing (phonics? comprehension? fluency?) and teach it. Behavior is the same. When a child can't meet an expectation, we need to figure out what's getting in the way and help them build that skill.",
    "howItWorks": "How It Works in Practice",
    "howItWorksDesc": "When we notice a child struggling with a particular situation — maybe transitions, sharing, or sitting still during story time — we don't wait for the next incident to punish. Instead, we have a calm conversation to understand what's making it hard and solve the problem together.",
    "step1Title": "Understand the child's perspective",

    "step3Example": "\"I wonder if there's a way for you to feel comfortable AND for story time to work for everyone. Do you have any ideas?\"",

    "q2": "\"What if my child can't think of solutions?\"",
    "a2": "That's okay! We can suggest ideas: \"What if we tried...? Would that work for you?\" The key is that both parties agree. Over time, children get better at generating their own solutions.",
    "q3": "\"What if the solution doesn't work?\"",
    "a3": "We try again! \"That solution isn't working well. Let's think of something else.\" It's an iterative process. Failed solutions give us more information about the real problem.",
    "q4": "\"Doesn't this take too much time?\"",
