children.","byFounders":"By Nutthanit and Marc Schwyn","intro1":"We're parents of three, and like you, we want the absolute best for our children. We see that pure wonder in their eyes, that natural joy, that bright spark that makes them who they are. It's the most beautiful thing in the world.","intro2":"So when the time came to choose a school for our first child, we couldn't find a single one that felt right. She was three - an age of pure magic and discovery. But every kindergarten we found was designed for parent convenience, not child development. Even the 'good' schools offered the same formula: sterile indoor rooms, artificial lights, plastic materials, and already the pressure to 'prepare for academic success.'","intro3":"Like so many of you, we couldn't bear the thought of watching the world slowly dim our children's magic and diminish their limitless potential.","movingTitle":"Moving to Phuket","moving1":"Five years ago, we decided the city wasn't working for us. We couldn't find the right school, children were trapped indoors, traffic and pollution made it hard to go anywhere, and we barely had time together as a family. So we moved to a beach in Phuket, hoping for more space, more nature, and more time with our children.","moving2":"What we discovered there was nothing short of magical. We learned that children completely transform when given two simple things: genuine time with their parents (we're talking 3-5 hours a day) and daily access to nature. That's it. No expensive programs, no complex methods. Just these two ingredients.","moving3":"The transformation is immediate and profound. Difficult children become helpful. Nagging stops. They ask to learn. They want to contribute. It sounds impossible, but any parent can test this - give your child focused time in nature for just a few days and watch the magic unfold.","struggleTitle":"Why Parents Struggle","struggle1":"Let's be honest about something that 95% of parents know but rarely say out loud: parenting in modern society is brutally, exhaustingly difficult.","struggle2":"It wasn't always this way. Historically, families lived in communities. When you had children, your parents, grandparents, neighbors, and extended family all helped raise them together. It truly took a village.","struggle3":"Today? You're not a village. You're isolated parents, often both working full-time jobs, with zero help at home. You wash dishes, do laundry, clean house, manage schedules, help with homework, handle bedtime routines - everything. When do you have 3-5 hours to just be present with your children? You barely have time to shower.","struggle4":"So you put them in front of screens just to recover. Not because you're a bad parent - because you're drowning.","dreamTitle":"Raising Dream Children","dream1":"Like you, we've always loved our children desperately and wanted the absolute best for them. We tried everything - researching the perfect foods, finding the best learning methods, carefully choosing their environment and friends, modeling the right behaviors. We read every parenting book, implemented every strategy.","dream2":"Then difficult times hit. Work demanded more. We were away more. And we watched our daughter transform - but not in a good way. She became difficult, naggy, bossy, rebellious. She absorbed negative influences from other children, from screens. She stopped listening to us. It broke our hearts.","dream3":"But here's when the pattern became undeniable: Every time we took a full weekend to just BE with our daughters - no distractions, just presence - they transformed back into the most magical beings. By Sunday night, they were perfect. Not obedient-robot perfect, but joyful, helpful, curious, loving perfect. Dream children.","dream4":"So we made a radical decision. When problems arose, we stopped reaching for punishments or explanations or any of the traditional parenting tools. We reached for time. Just time together.","dream5":"What happens when you genuinely spend time with your children is almost mystical. Those annoying behaviors they picked up from others? You mention you don't like them - maybe not the first time, maybe not even the fifth - but eventually they simply stop. Not because you punished them. Because they love you and when you're present, they naturally want to please you.","dream6":"But here's the deeper magic: Children learn by copying. When you're absent, they copy whoever is there - other children, screens, anyone. When you're present, they copy YOU. They mirror your mannerisms, your interests, your values. They spontaneously say \"I love you.\" They ask to learn what you know. They want to help with whatever you're doing.","natureTitle":"Why Nature Matters","nature1":"When we moved from our small Bangkok apartment to Phuket, just a minute's walk from the beach, we witnessed something that seemed impossible.","nature2":"Picture this: In our Bangkok apartment, our two daughters would fight constantly. Even with 50 toys available, they'd battle over the exact same one every 15 minutes. There's something about indoor spaces, about bought stuff, that creates competition and conflict.","nature3":"But take those exact same children at that exact same moment and walk outside into nature - to the woods, to our beach - and the fighting stops. Completely. They run around, play with sticks, dig in sand, splash in waves. Those sticks become toys, but somehow they don't fight over them. The competition vanishes.","nature4":"Nature floods children with endless questions: Why do leaves spiral that way? What made these tracks? Why does this mushroom grow on dead wood? Every walk outside presents infinite mysteries - a single tree holds more learning opportunities than a room full of educational posters.","nature5":"Our 3.5-rai palm plantation isn't just a pretty setting. It's a living laboratory where curiosity explodes naturally. Children discover Fibonacci patterns in real plants, witness life and death cycles, watch storms build and water find its path. They're not memorizing facts about physics - they're building dams and testing them. They're not studying ecosystems from books - they're living in one.","paradiseTitle":"The Paradise School","paradise1":"These discoveries changed everything about how we thought about education. If 3-5 hours of time transforms children... if nature eliminates conflict... if children desperately want to learn when we stop forcing them... then why are we sending them to schools designed around the exact opposite principles?","paradise2":"So we're building a paradise where parenting becomes easy, not exhausting. Where children naturally want to learn instead of resisting at every turn. Where they develop academic excellence, deep confidence, genuine social skills, physical vitality, emotional intelligence - all through joy instead of struggle. Where your child wakes up excited for each day and comes home energized, not depleted.","paradisePoints":{"environment":"Creating an Environment Children Want to Copy","environmentDesc":"Children don't learn by being taught. They learn by copying what surrounds them. Everything in our environment is designed to give the same message - the way teachers move and speak, what older children are doing, the materials available, the rhythm of the day.","timing":"Perfect Timing Multiplies Everything","timingDesc":"There's a window for every skill where children are naturally ready. Force reading at 3 when their bodies want to climb trees, and you create years of struggle. Wait until they're desperately curious at 6, and they learn in weeks what would have taken painful years.","tool":"The Right Tool at the Perfect Moment","toolDesc":"When a child hits a learning block, most schools just drill harder. We've learned that's like trying to break down a door when there's a key available.","community":"The Community That Multiplies Magic","communityDesc":"We've designed our location with spaces for regular family BBQs, farmers markets, workshops. When families align with what happens at school - not through rules but through genuine understanding - the transformation becomes unstoppable."},"paradise3":"This is what we're building. Not just another school, but a complete ecosystem designed around how children actually thrive. Where excellence isn't forced but emerges naturally. Where childhood isn't sacrificed for achievement but becomes the very source of it. Your children already have everything they need to be extraordinary. We're just creating the conditions where it happens naturally.","foundationTitle":"Our Educational Foundation","foundation1":"Our approach is rooted in Waldorf education, outdoor learning, the British curriculum, and the fundamental belief that children have a strong innate drive to learn and excel. We blend these elements differently at each developmental stage to nurture extraordinary human beings.","foundation2":"From our Nursery (ages 2-4) where we strengthen children's innate desire to learn, through Kindergarten (ages 3-6) where we identify and nurture each child's unique talents, to Primary (ages 6-9) where we fully cover the British curriculum while intensifying our focus on individual strengths — every stage is designed to help children reach their full potential.","ctaTitle":"Ready to See It for Yourself?","ctaDescription":"The best way to understand Bamboo Valley is to experience it.

This requires partnership between school and home. When we identify concerns, we'll share them honestly with you. We'll suggest approaches that work. We'll give you resources and support.","challenges3":"What we ask in return is openness. Work with us. Try what we suggest at home. Come to meetings when we request them. Trust that we want the same thing you do: for your child to be happy and successful.","challenges4":"For families who engage with us as partners, the results are remarkable. Children overcome challenges. Parents feel supported.

Challenging behavior is a signal: \"I'm stuck. There's something I can't figure out.\"","intro1":"Our approach is based on Collaborative & Proactive Solutions (CPS), developed by Dr. Ross Greene at Harvard Medical School. It's been used successfully in families, schools, and even juvenile detention facilities around the world.","intro2":"The core insight is simple but powerful: children who struggle with behavior aren't choosing to be difficult. They're lacking skills — skills like flexibility, frustration tolerance, or problem-solving. When we help them build these skills, the behavior improves naturally.","differentWay":"A Different Way of Thinking","traditionalThinking":"Traditional Thinking","traditionalMotto":"\"Kids do well if they want to\"","traditionalPoints":["Behavior is a choice","Child needs motivation (rewards/punishments)","If consequences are strong enough, behavior will change","Child is being defiant or manipulative"],"traditionalResult":"Result: Power struggles, temporary compliance, the problem keeps returning","ourApproachLabel":"Our Approach","ourApproachMotto":"\"Kids do well if they can\"","ourApproachPoints":["Behavior signals a lagging skill","Child needs help building skills","Understanding the problem leads to lasting solutions","Child is communicating \"I'm stuck\""],"ourApproachResult":"Result: Skills built, problems solved, relationship strengthened","whyConsequencesDontWork":"Why Consequences Alone Don't Work","consequences1":"Think about it this way: if your child could behave well just by being motivated, they would already be behaving well. No child wants to be in trouble. No child wants to disappoint their parents and teachers.","consequences2":"When a child struggles repeatedly despite consequences, it tells us something important: motivation isn't the problem. The child is lacking a skill — maybe emotional regulation, flexibility when plans change, or the ability to express frustration with words instead of actions.","analogy":"A helpful analogy: If a child struggled with reading, we wouldn't punish them for reading poorly. We'd figure out what specific skill they're missing (phonics? comprehension? fluency?) and teach it. Behavior is the same. When a child can't meet an expectation, we need to figure out what's getting in the way and help them build that skill.","howItWorks":"How It Works in Practice","howItWorksDesc":"When we notice a child struggling with a particular situation — maybe transitions, sharing, or sitting still during story time — we don't wait for the next incident to punish. Instead, we have a calm conversation to understand what's making it hard and solve the problem together.","step1Title":"Understand the child's perspective","step1Desc":"We start by getting curious, not judgmental. What's making this hard for you?","step1Example":"\"I've noticed it's been hard for you to stay seated during story time. What's going on?\"","step1Note":"We keep asking until we really understand. Often children reveal things we never would have guessed — maybe the chair hurts, or they can't see, or they're worried about something that happened earlier.","step2Title":"Share our concern","step2Desc":"We explain why this matters — not as a lecture, just as information.","step2Example":"\"The thing is, when you walk around during story time, it makes it hard for other kids to listen.\"","step2Note":"Just one simple sentence. Not \"because I said so\" — a genuine reason the child can understand.","step3Title":"Solve the problem together","step3Desc":"We brainstorm solutions that work for everyone — the child's concern AND our concern.","step3Example":"\"I wonder if there's a way for you to feel comfortable AND for story time to work for everyone. Do you have any ideas?\"","step3Note":"Children often come up with creative solutions adults never considered. Maybe they need a fidget toy, or a spot near the door, or a special cushion. We test each idea: does it solve both problems?","whyThisWorks":"Why This Works","buildsSkills":"It builds skills","buildsSkillsDesc":"Through this process, children learn to identify their own feelings, consider others' perspectives, and generate solutions. These are life skills they'll use forever.","solutionsLast":"Solutions last","solutionsLastDesc":"When children help create the solution, they're invested in making it work. It's their idea, not something imposed on them.","relationshipsStrengthen":"Relationships strengthen","relationshipsStrengthenDesc":"Children feel heard and understood. Adults become helpers rather than adversaries. Trust grows.","proactive":"It's proactive","proactiveDesc":"We solve problems during calm moments, not in the heat of crisis. Prevention is always better than reaction.","commonQuestions":"Common Questions","q1":"\"Isn't this too soft? Don't kids need consequences?\"","a1":"This isn't permissive parenting. Adult concerns are always part of the conversation, and solutions must work for everyone. The difference is we're solving problems collaboratively rather than imposing solutions that often don't work.","q2":"\"What if my child can't think of solutions?\"","a2":"That's okay! We can suggest ideas: \"What if we tried...? Would that work for you?\" The key is that both parties agree. Over time, children get better at generating their own solutions.","q3":"\"What if the solution doesn't work?\"","a3":"We try again! \"That solution isn't working well. Let's think of something else.\" It's an iterative process. Failed solutions give us more information about the real problem.","q4":"\"Doesn't this take too much time?\"","a4":"It takes time upfront, but saves enormous time later. Solving a problem durably takes less time than repeatedly dealing with the same behavior over and over.","researchTitle":"The Research Behind CPS","research1":"Collaborative & Proactive Solutions was developed by Dr. Ross Greene, formerly of Harvard Medical School. His research shows that challenging behavior is best understood as a learning problem — a delay in the development of crucial cognitive skills.","research2":"CPS has been implemented successfully in hundreds of schools, psychiatric units, and juvenile facilities. Research shows it reduces challenging behavior, improves relationships, and builds lasting skills.","researchLink":"Learn more: livesinthebalance.org | Books: The Explosive Child, Lost at School, Raising Human Beings","usingAtHome":"Using This Approach at Home","usingAtHomeDesc":"This approach works beautifully at home too. When your child struggles with something repeatedly — bedtime, homework, chores, siblings — try having a calm conversation:","homeStep1":"Get curious: \"I've noticed bedtime has been hard lately. What's going on?\"","homeStep2":"Share your concern: \"The thing is, you need enough sleep to feel good tomorrow.\"","homeStep3":"Brainstorm together: \"I wonder if there's a way for you to feel ready for bed AND get enough sleep.

They describe the problem from the outside without explaining what's happening on the inside.","differentApproach":"Our approach is different. Instead of asking \"What's wrong with this child?\", we ask: \"What skills is this child struggling to develop?\" and \"What specific situations is this child having difficulty with?\"","alsupTitle":"Lagging Skills & Unsolved Problems","alsupDesc":"We use a tool called ALSUP (Assessment of Lagging Skills and Unsolved Problems) to understand what's really going on. It's not a test or a diagnosis — it's a way of looking at a child that leads to real solutions.","laggingSkillsTitle":"Lagging Skills","laggingSkillsDesc":"Skills the child hasn't fully developed yet — like flexibility, frustration tolerance, or reading social cues. These explain why certain situations are hard.","unsolvedProblemsTitle":"Unsolved Problems","unsolvedProblemsDesc":"Specific situations where the child struggles — like \"staying seated during story time\" or \"transitioning from play to class.\" These are what we actually solve.","skillsTitle":"Skills Children Are Still Learning","skillsIntro":"All children are learning these skills.

We need to identify the exact situations where the child struggles.","unsolvedExamplesTitle":"Examples of Unsolved Problems","unsolvedExamples":["\"Difficulty staying seated during story time\"","\"Difficulty transitioning from free play to class time\"","\"Difficulty sharing materials during art activities\"","\"Difficulty waiting for a turn to speak during circle time\"","\"Difficulty when activities don't go as expected\""],"noJudgment":"Notice what's not in these statements: judgment, blame, or theories about motivation.

Morning? After free play? During certain activities?","pattern2":"When do they do well? What's different about those situations?","pattern3":"What happens right before? What triggers the difficulty?","pattern4":"What has been tried? What helped? What made things worse?","patternsConclusion":"These patterns give us clues about which lagging skills are involved and what kind of support the child needs.","solutionsTitle":"From Understanding to Solutions","solutionsDesc":"Once we understand which skills a child is lagging in and which specific situations are problematic, we can solve the problems collaboratively using the approach described in Our Approach.","realExample":"A Real Example","realExample1":"A child was constantly getting up during story time, disrupting others. Traditional approach: consequences for getting up. Result: didn't work — child kept doing it.","realExample2":"Assessment revealed: The child had high energy in the morning (after arriving) and couldn't sit still. It wasn't defiance — it was a regulation issue.","realExample3":"Collaborative solution: The child helped design an \"energy challenge\" — a quick circuit around the playground when they needed to move. They raise their hand, do the circuit, and return ready to focus. Problem solved, skill being built, relationship intact.","parentsRole":"Your Role in This Process","parentsRoleDesc":"You know your child better than anyone. When we're trying to understand what's going on, your insights are invaluable:","parentQuestions":["What situations are hard at home?","When do they do well?","What strategies have worked for you?","What do you notice about their energy, mood, or triggers?","What are they really good at?"],"parentsConclusion":"When school and home work together to understand a child, we get a complete picture. And complete pictures lead to better solutions.","notAboutLabeling":"This Isn't About Labeling","notAboutLabelingDesc":"Identifying lagging skills isn't about diagnosing or labeling your child. It's about understanding what they need to learn and how we can help them learn it. Every child has areas where they're still developing. Our job is to support that development with patience and skill.","learnMoreTitle":"Learn More","learnMoreDesc":"The ALSUP assessment is part of Dr. Ross Greene's Collaborative & Proactive Solutions approach. You can find free resources, including a printable ALSUP form, at:"},"behaviorSupport":{"heroTitle":"Behavior Support","heroSubtitle":"Clear rules. Fair consequences. A system that protects everyone while helping children learn.","corePrinciple":"Our approach: When a child breaks a rule, we respond with calm, consistent consequences — and then we work to understand why it happened so we can prevent it next time. Consequences without understanding doesn't teach. Understanding without consequences doesn't protect.","fourRulesTitle":"The 4 Rules","fourRulesDesc":"These rules apply to all children, all the time, in all settings. We teach them through stories, role-play, and daily practice.","rule1":"Gentle Hands","rule1Desc":"No pushing, hitting, or grabbing","rule2":"Kind Voice","rule2Desc":"No yelling, mean words, or teasing","rule3":"Share & Wait","rule3Desc":"Take turns, practice patience","rule4":"Everyone Plays","rule4Desc":"\"You can't play\" is not allowed","howWeRespond":"How We Respond","howWeRespondDesc":"Not all incidents are the same. A child grabbing a toy is different from a child hurting someone on purpose. Our response matches the severity — clear, predictable, and fair.","tier1Title":"Tier 1 — Minor Incidents","tier1Examples":"Examples","tier1ExamplesList":["Pushing or shoving (no injury)","Grabbing toys","Mean words or teasing","Not sharing or waiting turn","Excluding others from play"],"tier1WhatHappens":"What Happens","tier1Response":"Playtime pauses briefly. The child chooses a calm activity (watering plants, cleaning toys, etc.) until they're ready to rejoin. Then they get a fresh start — no lecture, no lingering consequences.","tier1Communication":"Parent communication: Verbal update at pickup if notable. Written note if 3+ incidents in one week.","tier2Title":"Tier 2 — Moderate Incidents","tier2ExamplesList":["Repeated minor incidents (3+ in a week)","Targeting a specific child","Breaking materials on purpose","Rough play causing minor injury","Refusing to follow safety rules"],"tier2Response":"Free play is done for the day. The child sits with a teacher doing a quiet activity for the rest of the play period. Before rejoining regular activities, they must make repair with the affected child.","tier2Communication":"Parent communication: Same-day message or call. If patterns continue, we schedule a meeting.","tier3Title":"Tier 3 — Serious Incidents","tier3ExamplesList":["Physical aggression causing injury","Using objects to hurt others","Repeated pattern of harm","Threatening behavior","Behavior endangering others"],"tier3Response":"The child is removed from group activities immediately and supervised 1-on-1. Management is notified. Parents are called — same-day pickup may be required.","tier3Communication":"Parent communication: Immediate phone call. Incident report provided. Meeting required before child returns.","escalationTitle":"If Serious Incidents Continue","escalationDesc":"We believe in giving children chances to learn and grow. But we also have a responsibility to protect all children. Here's what happens when serious incidents continue:","incident1":"1st serious incident","incident1Response":"Parent meeting. Behavior contract introduced.","incident2":"2nd serious incident","incident2Response":"Behavior contract signed. Formal monitoring begins.","incident3":"3rd serious incident","incident3Response":"Child sent home for the day. Meeting required before return.","incident4":"4th serious incident","incident4Response":"Suspension (1-3 days). Enrollment review.","beyondConsequences":"Beyond Consequences","beyondConsequences1":"Consequences address the moment. But they don't solve the underlying problem. That's why we also work to understand why a child is struggling and help them develop the skills they need.","beyondConsequences2":"When patterns emerge, we use a process called ALSUP (Assessment of Lagging Skills and Unsolved Problems) to identify what's getting in the way. Then we work collaboratively — teachers, parents, and sometimes the child — to find solutions.","learnMoreLinks":"Learn more: Our Understanding Your Child page explains how we identify what's really going on when a child struggles. Our Our Approach page covers the philosophy behind working with children collaboratively.","whatWeAskTitle":"What We Ask of Parents","whatWeAskDesc":"This system works best when school and home are aligned. When we reach out about behavioral concerns, we ask that you:","whatWeAskItems":["Listen with an open mind — we're sharing concerns, not accusations","Attend meetings when requested","Try suggested strategies at home","Share information that might help us understand your child better","Work with us as partners, not adversaries"],"whatWeAskConclusion":"For families who engage with us this way, the results are often remarkable. Children develop new skills. Behaviors improve. Everyone feels supported."},"separationAnxiety":{"heroTitle":"Separation Anxiety","heroSubtitle":"Why tears at drop-off are actually a good sign — and how to help","goodNews":"First, the good news: Separation anxiety is a sign of healthy attachment. It means your child loves deeply and trusts completely. Children who don't protest at all when caregivers leave can actually be a concern. Your child's tears show the bond is strong — now we just help them learn that goodbyes aren't forever.","whyHappens":"Why This Happens","whyHappens1":"When a young child cries at separation, their brain is doing exactly what it evolved to do: keeping the people they love close. This is the foundation of healthy human connection.","whyHappens2":"The challenge isn't to eliminate this instinct — it's to help your child build trust that:","trustPoints":["You always come back","They are safe when you're away","The teachers can be trusted too"],"whyHappens3":"Research shows children with strong separation responses often develop into securely attached, emotionally healthy adults — when handled correctly.","researchTitle":"What the Research Tells Us","research1Title":"Stress peaks during anticipation, not after you leave.","research1Desc":"Studies measuring cortisol (the stress hormone) found that levels spike while waiting for the parent to leave — and stay elevated during prolonged goodbyes. The uncertainty is harder than the separation itself.","research2Title":"Children read your emotions.","research2Desc":"Research shows that parents can either \"buffer\" or \"amplify\" their child's stress response. When you appear anxious or sad, your child's stress rises. When you appear calm and confident, it helps regulate theirs.","research3Title":"Adjustment takes about 3 months.","research3Desc":"Studies show that children's stress hormone levels normalize after approximately 3 months of consistent childcare — but only with predictable routines and confident goodbyes.","bottomLine":"The bottom line: Quick, confident goodbyes aren't \"cold\" — they're kinder. They reduce the anticipation phase (where stress is highest) and show your child there's nothing to worry about.","whatHelps":"What Helps at Drop-off","whatToDo":"What to Do","doItems":["Keep goodbyes under 1 minute — reduces anticipation stress","Sound confident and calm — your calm regulates their calm","Hand them to a teacher — physical transfer to a trusted adult","Walk away without looking back — hesitation signals danger","Trust the process — most children calm within 5-10 minutes"],"whatToAvoid":"What to Avoid","avoidItems":["Sneaking away — breaks trust, increases vigilance next time","Multiple \"one more hug\" — prolongs the stressful anticipation","Coming back when you hear crying — teaches that crying brings you back","Looking worried or sad — amplifies their stress response"],"sampleScript":"A Simple Script","scriptText":"\"I love you! Teacher [name] will take care of you. I'll be back after [lunch/nap/outside play]. Bye bye!\"","scriptNote":"→ Hug, hand to teacher, walk out confidently.","whatToExpect":"What to Expect","week1":"Week 1","week1Desc":"Crying at drop-off. This is normal.","week2":"Week 2-3","week2Desc":"Crying decreases. Calms faster. Engages sooner.","month2":"Month 2","month2Desc":"Brief fussing. Quick recovery. Happy during day.","month3":"Month 3","month3Desc":"Waves goodbye. Fully adjusted.","gentleStart":"A Gentle Start (Optional)","gentleStartDesc":"If jumping straight to full days feels too hard, you can gradually increase the separation time.

Young children understand routines — clocks don't mean much yet.","whatTeachersDo":"What We Do After You Leave","whatTeachersDoDesc":"Our teachers are trained to support children through this transition:","teacherActions":["Warm, calm reception — we become the \"borrowed calm\"","Immediate redirection — engaging activities shift focus","Brief acknowledgment — \"I know. Mommy always comes back.\"","Moving on — we don't dwell on the sadness"],"teachersAvoid":"We never make a fuss over crying (which reinforces it), repeatedly discuss the absent parent (which keeps focus on the absence), or call you back (which teaches that crying brings you back).","whyWorks":"Why This Works","whyWorksDesc":"Every successful goodbye teaches your child's brain: \"Parent leaves, parent comes back, I survive, I'm okay.\" This builds the neural pathways for secure attachment — the foundation for confidence throughout life. It feels hard now, but you're giving them a gift that lasts forever.","whenToConcern":"When to Talk to Us","whenToConcernDesc":"Most separation anxiety resolves within a few weeks to a couple months. Please reach out if:","concernItems":["Anxiety doesn't improve after 2-3 months","Your child seems anxious throughout the entire day (not just drop-off)","There's been a recent significant change (new sibling, move, family stress)","You're struggling with the drop-off process yourself"],"concernConclusion":"We can work together to create a tailored plan.
