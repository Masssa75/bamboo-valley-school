ชวิน","intro1":"เราเป็นพ่อแม่ของลูก 3 คน และเหมือนคุณ เราต้องการสิ่งที่ดีที่สุดสำหรับลูกๆ เราเห็นความมหัศจรรย์บริสุทธิ์ในดวงตาของพวกเขา ความสุขตามธรรมชาติ ประกายสดใสที่ทำให้พวกเขาเป็นตัวของตัวเอง มันเป็นสิ่งที่สวยงามที่สุดในโลก","intro2":"ดังนั้นเมื่อถึงเวลาเลือกโรงเรียนให้ลูกคนแรก เราหาโรงเรียนที่รู้สึกถูกต้องไม่ได้เลย เธออายุ 3 ขวบ - วัยแห่งความมหัศจรรย์และการค้นพบ แต่ทุกโรงเรียนอนุบาลที่เราพบถูกออกแบบเพื่อความสะดวกของผู้ปกครอง ไม่ใช่พัฒนาการของเด็ก แม้แต่โรงเรียน 'ดี' ก็เสนอสูตรเดิม: ห้องในร่มที่ปลอดเชื้อ แสงประดิษฐ์ วัสดุพลาสติก และแรงกดดันที่จะ 'เตรียมพร้อมสำหรับความสำเร็จทางวิชาการ' อยู่แล้ว","intro3":"เหมือนพวกคุณหลายคน เราทนไม่ได้ที่จะคิดว่าจะต้องดูโลกค่อยๆ ทำให้ความมหัศจรรย์ของลูกๆ จางลงและลดศักยภาพไร้ขีดจำกัดของพวกเขา","movingTitle":"ย้ายมาภูเก็ต","moving1":"ห้าปีก่อน เราตัดสินใจว่าเมืองไม่ได้ผลสำหรับเรา เราหาโรงเรียนที่ถูกต้องไม่ได้ เด็กๆ ถูกขังอยู่ในร่ม การจราจรและมลพิษทำให้ไปไหนยาก และเราแทบไม่มีเวลาอยู่ด้วยกันเป็นครอบครัว ดังนั้นเราจึงย้ายมาชายหาดในภูเก็ต หวังจะได้พื้นที่มากขึ้น ธรรมชาติมากขึ้น และเวลากับลูกๆ มากขึ้น","moving2":"สิ่งที่เราค้นพบที่นั่นเป็นอะไรที่มหัศจรรย์มาก เราได้เรียนรู้ว่าเด็กๆ เปลี่ยนแปลงอย่างสิ้นเชิงเมื่อได้รับสองสิ่งง่ายๆ: เวลาที่แท้จริงกับพ่อแม่ (เรากำลังพูดถึง 3-5 ชั่วโมงต่อวัน) และการเข้าถึงธรรมชาติทุกวัน แค่นั้น ไม่ต้องมีโปรแกรมราคาแพง ไม่ต้องมีวิธีการซับซ้อน แค่สองส่วนผสมนี้","moving3":"การเปลี่ยนแปลงเกิดขึ้นทันทีและลึกซึ้ง เด็กที่ยากกลายเป็นคนช่วยเหลือ การบ่นหยุด พวกเขาขอเรียนรู้ พวกเขาต้องการมีส่วนร่วม ฟังดูเป็นไปไม่ได้ แต่พ่อแม่คนไหนก็ทดสอบได้ - ให้เวลาที่มุ่งเน้นกับลูกในธรรมชาติแค่ไม่กี่วันและดูความมหัศจรรย์ที่เกิดขึ้น","struggleTitle":"ทำไมพ่อแม่ถึงลำบาก","struggle1":"มาพูดตรงๆ เกี่ยวกับสิ่งที่ 95% ของพ่อแม่รู้แต่ไม่ค่อยพูดออกมาดังๆ: การเลี้ยงลูกในสังคมสมัยใหม่ยากลำบากอย่างโหดร้ายและเหน็ดเหนื่อย","struggle2":"มันไม่ได้เป็นแบบนี้เสมอไป ในประวัติศาสตร์ ครอบครัวอาศัยอยู่ในชุมชน เมื่อคุณมีลูก พ่อแม่ ปู่ย่าตายาย เพื่อนบ้าน และครอบครัวขยายทั้งหมดช่วยกันเลี้ยงพวกเขาด้วยกัน มันต้องอาศัยทั้งหมู่บ้านจริงๆ","struggle3":"วันนี้? คุณไม่ใช่หมู่บ้าน คุณเป็นพ่อแม่ที่โดดเดี่ยว มักจะทำงานเต็มเวลาทั้งคู่ โดยไม่มีความช่วยเหลือที่บ้านเลย คุณล้างจาน ซักผ้า ทำความสะอาดบ้าน จัดการตารางเวลา ช่วยทำการบ้าน จัดการกิจวัตรก่อนนอน - ทุกอย่าง คุณมีเวลา 3-5 ชั่วโมงที่จะอยู่กับลูกเมื่อไหร่? คุณแทบไม่มีเวลาอาบน้ำ","struggle4":"ดังนั้นคุณจึงให้พวกเขาดูหน้าจอเพื่อฟื้นตัว ไม่ใช่เพราะคุณเป็นพ่อแม่ที่ไม่ดี - แต่เพราะคุณกำลังจมน้ำ","dreamTitle":"เลี้ยงลูกในฝัน","dream1":"เหมือนคุณ เรารักลูกอย่างสุดซึ้งและต้องการสิ่งที่ดีที่สุดสำหรับพวกเขาเสมอ เราลองทุกอย่าง - ค้นคว้าอาหารที่สมบูรณ์แบบ หาวิธีการเรียนรู้ที่ดีที่สุด เลือกสภาพแวดล้อมและเพื่อนอย่างระมัดระวัง เป็นแบบอย่างพฤติกรรมที่ถูกต้อง เราอ่านหนังสือเลี้ยงลูกทุกเล่ม ใช้ทุกกลยุทธ์","dream2":"แล้วช่วงเวลายากลำบากก็มาถึง งานเรียกร้องมากขึ้น เราไม่อยู่มากขึ้น และเราเห็นลูกสาวเปลี่ยนแปลง - แต่ไม่ใช่ในทางที่ดี เธอกลายเป็นคนยาก บ่น ชอบสั่ง ดื้อ เธอซึมซับอิทธิพลเชิงลบจากเด็กคนอื่น จากหน้าจอ เธอหยุดฟังเรา มันทำให้ใจเราสลาย","dream3":"แต่นี่คือตอนที่รูปแบบกลายเป็นสิ่งที่ปฏิเสธไม่ได้: ทุกครั้งที่เราใช้เวลาสุดสัปดาห์เต็มๆ แค่อยู่กับลูกสาว - ไม่มีสิ่งรบกวน แค่การมีอยู่ - พวกเธอก็กลับมาเป็นสิ่งมหัศจรรย์ที่สุด ถึงคืนวันอาทิตย์ พวกเธอสมบูรณ์แบบ ไม่ใช่สมบูรณ์แบบแบบหุ่นยนต์เชื่อฟัง แต่สมบูรณ์แบบแบบมีความสุข ช่วยเหลือ อยากรู้อยากเห็น รักใคร่ ลูกในฝัน","dream4":"ดังนั้นเราจึงตัดสินใจอย่างรุนแรง เมื่อปัญหาเกิดขึ้น เราหยุดหยิบการลงโทษหรือคำอธิบายหรือเครื่องมือการเลี้ยงลูกแบบดั้งเดิมใดๆ เราหยิบเวลา แค่เวลาด้วยกัน","dream5":"สิ่งที่เกิดขึ้นเมื่อคุณใช้เวลากับลูกอย่างแท้จริงนั้นเกือบจะลึกลับ พฤติกรรมน่ารำคาญที่พวกเขาเลียนแบบจากคนอื่น? คุณบอกว่าคุณไม่ชอบ - อาจไม่ใช่ครั้งแรก อาจไม่ใช่ครั้งที่ห้า - แต่ในที่สุดพวกเขาก็หยุด ไม่ใช่เพราะคุณลงโทษพวกเขา แต่เพราะพวกเขารักคุณและเมื่อคุณอยู่ พวกเขาต้องการทำให้คุณพอใจโดยธรรมชาติ","dream6":"แต่นี่คือความมหัศจรรย์ที่ลึกกว่า: เด็กเรียนรู้โดยการเลียนแบบ เมื่อคุณไม่อยู่ พวกเขาเลียนแบบใครก็ตามที่อยู่ - เด็กคนอื่น หน้าจอ ใครก็ได้ เมื่อคุณอยู่ พวกเขาเลียนแบบคุณ พวกเขาสะท้อนกิริยา ความสนใจ คุณค่าของคุณ พวกเขาพูดว่า 'ฉันรักคุณ' เอง พวกเขาขอเรียนรู้สิ่งที่คุณรู้ พวกเขาต้องการช่วยสิ่งที่คุณกำลังทำ","natureTitle":"ทำไมธรรมชาติจึงสำคัญ","nature1":"เมื่อเราย้ายจากอพาร์ตเมนต์เล็กๆ ในกรุงเทพฯ มาภูเก็ต แค่เดินหนึ่งนาทีจากชายหาด เราเห็นสิ่งที่ดูเหมือนเป็นไปไม่ได้","nature2":"ลองนึกภาพ: ในอพาร์ตเมนต์ในกรุงเทพฯ ลูกสาวสองคนของเราทะเลาะกันตลอดเวลา แม้จะมีของเล่น 50 ชิ้น พวกเธอก็แย่งชิ้นเดียวกันทุก 15 นาที มีบางอย่างเกี่ยวกับพื้นที่ในร่ม เกี่ยวกับของที่ซื้อมา ที่สร้างการแข่งขันและความขัดแย้ง","nature3":"แต่พาเด็กเหล่านั้นในขณะเดียวกันเดินออกไปข้างนอกสู่ธรรมชาติ - ไปป่า ไปชายหาดของเรา - และการทะเลาะหยุด หมดเลย พวกเธอวิ่งไปรอบๆ เล่นกับกิ่งไม้ ขุดทราย สาดน้ำ กิ่งไม้เหล่านั้นกลายเป็นของเล่น แต่อย่างไรก็ตามพวกเธอไม่ทะเลาะกันเรื่องมัน การแข่งขันหายไป","nature4":"ธรรมชาติท่วมเด็กๆ ด้วยคำถามไม่รู้จบ: ทำไมใบไม้หมุนเป็นเกลียวแบบนั้น? อะไรทำให้เกิดรอยเหล่านี้? ทำไมเห็ดนี้ขึ้นบนไม้ที่ตายแล้ว? การเดินเล่นข้างนอกทุกครั้งนำเสนอความลึกลับไม่สิ้นสุด - ต้นไม้ต้นเดียวมีโอกาสการเรียนรู้มากกว่าห้องที่เต็มไปด้วยโปสเตอร์การศึกษา","nature5":"สวนปาล์ม 3.5 ไร่ของเราไม่ใช่แค่ฉากหลังที่สวยงาม มันเป็นห้องทดลองที่มีชีวิตซึ่งความอยากรู้อยากเห็นระเบิดออกมาโดยธรรมชาติ เด็กๆ ค้นพบรูปแบบ Fibonacci ในพืชจริง เห็นวงจรชีวิตและความตาย ดูพายุก่อตัวและน้ำหาทางไป พวกเขาไม่ได้ท่องจำข้อเท็จจริงเกี่ยวกับฟิสิกส์ - พวกเขากำลังสร้างเขื่อนและทดสอบมัน พวกเขาไม่ได้ศึกษาระบบนิเวศจากหนังสือ - พวกเขาอาศัยอยู่ในนั้น","paradiseTitle":"โรงเรียนในสวรรค์","paradise1":"การค้นพบเหล่านี้เปลี่ยนทุกอย่างเกี่ยวกับวิธีที่เราคิดเกี่ยวกับการศึกษา ถ้า 3-5 ชั่วโมงของเวลาเปลี่ยนแปลงเด็กๆ... ถ้าธรรมชาติขจัดความขัดแย้ง... ถ้าเด็กๆ ต้องการเรียนรู้อย่างยิ่งเมื่อเราหยุดบังคับพวกเขา... แล้วทำไมเราถึงส่งพวกเขาไปโรงเรียนที่ออกแบบตามหลักการตรงกันข้าม?","paradise2":"ดังนั้นเราจึงกำลังสร้างสวรรค์ที่การเลี้ยงลูกกลายเป็นเรื่องง่าย ไม่ใช่เหนื่อยล้า ที่เด็กๆ ต้องการเรียนรู้โดยธรรมชาติแทนที่จะต่อต้านทุกครั้ง ที่พวกเขาพัฒนาความเป็นเลิศทางวิชาการ ความมั่นใจลึกซึ้ง ทักษะสังคมที่แท้จริง พลังกาย ความฉลาดทางอารมณ์ - ทั้งหมดผ่านความสุขแทนการต่อสู้ ที่ลูกของคุณตื่นขึ้นมาตื่นเต้นในแต่ละวันและกลับบ้านมีพลัง ไม่ใช่เหนื่อยล้า","paradisePoints":{"environment":"สร้างสภาพแวดล้อมที่เด็กๆ อยากเลียนแบบ","environmentDesc":"เด็กไม่ได้เรียนรู้จากการถูกสอน
